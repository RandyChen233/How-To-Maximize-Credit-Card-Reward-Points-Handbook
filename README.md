### Motivations
In recent years, the use of credit card reward programs has skyrocketed, driven by the expanding travel market, increased competition among credit card issuers, and the rise of savvy consumers seeking to maximize their spending power. The allure of earning points and miles from everyday purchases, combined with lucrative sign-up bonuses and travel perks, has made credit cards a powerful tool for consumers who wish to enhance their lifestyles while stretching their dollars further.

Credit card reward programs are no longer the domain of frequent business travelers alone. Today, students, families, entrepreneurs, and everyday consumers have access to a variety of rewards tailored to their needs. Social media platforms, personal finance blogs, and ``travel hackers'' have popularized the art of maximizing credit card points, often sharing tips and success stories of how theyâ€™ve redeemed points for free flights, luxury hotel stays, and more.

This increasing accessibility has contributed to a vibrant community of users eager to get the best returns from their spending habits. However, navigating the complexities of these programs can be daunting for beginners, with information scattered across different sources and subject to constant change as issuers adjust their offerings. This handbook aims to bring clarity to the process of understanding and maximizing credit card rewards, such as redeeming first-class seats on trans-continental long-haul flights (which I have done multiple times, such as using American Airline miles to redeem business class on Japan Airlines from USA-China) or redeeming free rooms at luxury hotels such as St. Regis (Resort), Waldorf Astoria, Ritz Carlton, etc (which I have also done multiple times before).

### Note:
This handbook is still a work in progress. It contains all the essential information for a novice in the credit card points game to get a head start, but it has yet to cover all the hidden sweet spots and redemptions that you can only find on credit card points forums such as [US credit card guide](https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/en/) or the famous [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/).
